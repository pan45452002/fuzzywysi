# FuzzyWysi

This is still very early code. 

Inspired by [WysiHat](http://github.com/josh/wysihat/tree/master) but built atop jQuery, FuzzyWysi inspires to be lightweight and customizable with code, not configuration options.

## Support Platforms

It currently works with:

* Firefox 3
* Safari 3

I haven't tested it with anything else yet, but IE support is planned.

## Dependencies

* [jQuery](http://jquery.com) 1.2.6 or later
